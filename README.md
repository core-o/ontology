# Core-O: A Competence Reference Ontology for Professional and Learning Ecosystems

The objective of Core-O is to support the representation of competences and related elements (skills, knowledge, attitudes) both at the individual level, i.e., when these elements are attributed to particular individuals, but also when required by occupations in general. It addresses also the performance of competences (related to tasks, their context, and outcomes) as well as their evolution over time.

A reference version in OntoUML and a gUFO-based operational version in OWL are included here.

See <http://purl.org/nemo/doc/gufo> for the foundational ontology employed.

To import gUFO in Protégé use <https://purl.org/coreo#> (using `https` instead of `http`). (This is required in Protégé up to 5.6.1 as it uses a version of the OWL API that is unable to handle multiple http redirects.)
